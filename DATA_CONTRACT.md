# Data Contract

This document defines which files belong to the **system** (auto-updatable) and which belong to the **user** (never touched by updates).

## User Layer (NEVER auto-updated)

These files contain your personal data, customizations, and work product. Updates will NEVER modify them.

|------|---------|
| `cv.md` | Your CV in markdown |
| `config/profile.yml` | Your identity, targets, comp range |
| `config/scythe.yml` | Your private Scythe targeting, remote-work policy, proof-point references, and pilot preferences |
| `modes/_profile.md` | Your archetypes, narrative, negotiation scripts |
| `modes/_custom.md` | Your house rules, custom workflows & output preferences (procedural — survives updates) |

| `data/pipeline.md` | Your URL inbox |
| `data/scan-history.tsv` | Your scan history |
| `data/follow-ups.md` | Your follow-up history |
| `writing-samples/*` | Your personal writing samples for style calibration (except `writing-samples/README.md`, which is system-owned documentation delivered by updates) |

| `output/*` | Your generated PDFs |
| `briefs/*` | Your generated outbound diagnostic briefs |

## The Rule

**If a file is in the User Layer, no update process may read, modify, or delete it.**

**If a file is in the System Layer, it can be safely replaced with the latest version from the upstream repo.**
